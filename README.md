# COVID-project
Python project for the Scientific Programming course of the Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics MSc.
In a Jupyter Notebook, the computation of COVID-19 R0 and plots of the cases in Italy are performed.

## Visualization and notebook operability
If the notebook is not rendered by github, it's possible to view it at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dacolombo/COVID-project/blob/main/R0_project.ipynb).

To better use the notebook, especially the interactive part at the end, download and open it with Jupyter.
